**Senior Systems Administrator | GRC & Security Operations**

Welcome to my code repository. This collection focuses on PowerShell automation, infrastructure reliability, and security compliance tools designed for high-assurance environments (DoD/Defense).

My goal is to bridge the gap between **Compliance requirements** and **Operational reality** through automation.  I don't want to make automation scripts to get the job done.  I want to get it done for the right reason.

## 📂 Project Index

### 🛡️ Projects and Scripts 
* **(DoD Cert Install)**
  * Automate the installation of necessary DoD root certs that are required for full functionality within a DoD environment.
  * Both BAT and PowerShell versions. 

* **(Exchange/Noisy Senders)**
  * Too much noise meant people were tuning them out.  This script helped achieve a level of clarity that we were missing.
* **(Exchange/DAG Status)**
  * Email reports with HTML were being ignored or lost in the noise.  I created a script that outputs it to a spreadsheet that requires human review.
