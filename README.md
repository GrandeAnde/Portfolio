**Senior Systems Administrator | GRC & Security Operations**

Welcome to my code repository. This collection focuses on PowerShell automation, infrastructure reliability, and security compliance tools designed for high-assurance environments (DoD/Defense).

My goal is to bridge the gap between **Compliance requirements** and **Operational reality** through automation.  I don't want to make automation scripts to get the job done.  I want to get it done for the right reason.
